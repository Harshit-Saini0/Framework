# AP US History Framework Study Tool

With the APUSH exam approaching quickly, I wanted to make a simple way to efficiently study. My teacher had consistently emphasized that the framework was the key to success on the exam, and although I agreed, studying directly off the framework was less than ideal. 

In response, I started working on a tool that presented the framework in a more easily navigable format and also provided additional study aids with specific examples for each sub-concept. I created the design to best suit the ways of studying I've found to be most effective this year and the way I wanted to study using the framework. 
At this point in the workflow, the program did not substantially differ from the framework itself, and so I wanted to explore ways to strengthen the more open-ended aspects of the course, such as the development of historical thinking skills (contextualization, comparison, causation, and continuity and change over time). 
We then added another tool that connected every key concept to each historical thinking skill in order to further develop these skills. 
With this additional tool, we shifted focus from solely the specific facts and events in history to understanding the broader historical processes which tie those specifics together. 

This project demonstrates a unique approach to studying for APUSH. It incorporated knowledge I've had, as I developed it through code, knowledge I've gained through my time in AMSTUD, like how to study effectively, as well as new knowledge I gained as needed for this project, including HTML and design.
