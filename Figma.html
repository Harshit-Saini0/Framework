The causes of the Columbian Exchange include European exploration and colonization of the Americas, as well as the desire for new trade routes and resources.<br /><br />The effects of the Columbian Exchange include the spread of new crops and animals between the Old World and New World, as well as the spread of diseases such as smallpox that had devastating effects on Native American populations."
	, "Over time, Native Americans were subjected to a variety of policies and practices by European colonizers that had significant impacts on their societies and cultures. These policies and practices included forced labor, forced conversion to Christianity, and forced removal from their ancestral lands. Over time, Native American populations declined dramatically as a result of these policies and practices, and many Native American cultures were destroyed or severely disrupted."

	["The colonization and migration patterns of Europeans in North America were influenced by different imperial goals, cultures, and the varied North American environments where they settled. These patterns of colonization and migration had significant impacts on the social and political development of European colonies as well as their relationships with native populations.<br /><br />For example, Spanish colonizers developed institutions based on subjugating native populations, converting them to Christianity, and incorporating them into Spanish colonial society. French and Dutch colonial efforts involved relatively few Europeans and relied on trade alliances and intermarriage with American Indians to build economic and diplomatic relationships and acquire furs and other products for export to Europe. English colonization efforts attracted a comparatively large number of male and female British migrants, as well as other European migrants, all of whom sought social mobility, economic prosperity, religious freedom, and improved living conditions."
	,"The Chesapeake and North Carolina colonies grew prosperous exporting tobacco — a labor-intensive product initially cultivated by white, mostly male indentured servants and later by enslaved Africans. The New England colonies, initially settled by Puritans, developed around small towns with family farms and achieved a thriving mixed economy of agriculture and commerce.<br /><br />One similarity between these two regions is that they both relied on agriculture as a major source of economic growth. However, the Chesapeake and North Carolina colonies relied on tobacco as their primary cash crop while the New England colonies relied on mixed farming and commerce.<br /><br />One difference between these two regions is that the Chesapeake and North Carolina colonies relied heavily on indentured servants and later enslaved Africans to cultivate their crops while the New England colonies relied more on family farms."	
	,"The development of different economic systems in British colonies in North America was influenced by a variety of factors. One important factor was the availability of land. In the Chesapeake and North Carolina colonies, for example, land was relatively abundant and cheap, which encouraged the development of large plantations that relied on indentured servants and later enslaved Africans to cultivate tobacco.<br /><br />In contrast, land was relatively scarce and expensive in New England, which encouraged the development of small family farms that relied on mixed farming and commerce.<br /><br />Another important factor was the availability of labor. In the Chesapeake and North Carolina colonies, indentured servants and later enslaved Africans were readily available to cultivate crops. In New England, however, there were relatively few indentured servants or enslaved Africans, which encouraged the development of family farms that relied on family labor."	
	,"The English colonies in North America experienced significant changes in their social and political structures over time. In the early years of colonization, most colonies were governed by joint-stock companies or proprietors who had been granted charters by the English monarchs. These companies and proprietors had significant power over the colonies and often made decisions without input from colonists.<br /><br />Over time, however, colonists began to demand more representation in colonial governments. In Virginia, for example, colonists demanded that the governor call a representative assembly to address their grievances. This assembly became known as the House of Burgesses and was the first representative assembly in British North America.<br /><br />Despite these changes, some aspects of colonial society remained relatively constant over time. For example, most colonies relied heavily on indentured servants and later enslaved Africans to cultivate crops and perform other labor-intensive tasks."

	["The British colonies experienced a gradual Anglicization over time, developing autonomous political communities based on English models with influence from inter-colonial commercial ties, the emergence of a trans-Atlantic print culture, and the spread of Protestant evangelicalism. The presence of different European religious and ethnic groups contributed to a significant degree of pluralism and intellectual exchange, which were later enhanced by the First Great Awakening and the spread of European Enlightenment ideas. The ideas of the Enlightenment, which emphasized science and reason over faith and superstition, strongly influenced the American colonies in the eighteenth century."
	, "The Great Awakening promoted a fervent, emotional religiosity while the Enlightenment encouraged the pursuit of reason in all things. On both sides of the Atlantic, British subjects grappled with these new ideas.<br /><br />The presence of different European religious and ethnic groups contributed to a significant degree of pluralism and intellectual exchange, which were later enhanced by the First Great Awakening and the spread of European Enlightenment ideas.

	, "The British colonies participated in political, social, cultural, and economic exchanges with Great Britain that encouraged both stronger bonds with Britain and resistance to Britain’s control. This exchange was due to the presence of different European religious and ethnic groups that contributed to a significant degree of pluralism and intellectual exchange which were later enhanced by the First Great Awakening and the spread of European Enlightenment ideas.<br /><br />The British colonies experienced a gradual Anglicization over time, developing autonomous political communities based on English models with influence from inter-colonial commercial ties, the emergence of a trans-Atlantic print culture, and the spread of Protestant evangelicalism.<br /><br />The British government increasingly attempted to incorporate its North American colonies into a coherent, hierarchical, and imperial structure in order to pursue mercantilist economic aims, but conflicts with colonists and American Indians led to erratic enforcement of imperial policies. Colonists’ resistance to imperial control drew on local experiences of self-government, evolving ideas of liberty, the political thought of the Enlightenment, greater religious independence and diversity, and an ideology critical of perceived corruption in the imperial system"
	, "All the British colonies participated to varying degrees in the Atlantic slave trade due to the abundance of land and a growing European demand for colonial goods, as well as a shortage of indentured servants. As chattel slavery became the dominant labor system in many southern colonies, new laws created a strict racial system that prohibited interracial relationships and defined the descendants of African American mothers as black and enslaved in perpetuity. Africans developed both overt and covert means to resist the dehumanizing aspects of slavery and continue practices relating to their family and gender systems, culture, and religion."

	["Colonial rivalry intensified between Britain and France in the mid-18th century, as the growing population of the British colonies expanded into the interior of North America, threatening French–Indian trade networks and American Indian autonomy. This rivalry culminated in the Seven years’ War (the French and Indian War), in which Britain defeated France and allied American Indians. The war was fought over control of North America and was part of a larger global conflict known as the Seven Years’ War.<br /><br />The desire of many colonists to assert ideals of self-government in the face of renewed British imperial efforts led to a colonial independence movement and war with Britain. For example, after Britain achieved a major expansion of its territorial holdings by defeating France in the Seven Years’ War, it set out to raise revenue and consolidate control over its colonies. This led to imperial officials’ attempts to prevent colonists from moving westward which generated colonial opposition. Native groups also sought to both continue trading with Europeans and resist the encroachments of colonists on tribal lands."
	," British attempts to assert tighter control over its North American colonies and the colonial resolve to pursue self-government led to a colonial independence movement and the Revolutionary War. The Seven Years’ War, also known as the French and Indian War, led to the British defeat of France and allied Native Americans.<br /><br />The British victory over France in the imperial struggle for North America led to new conflicts among the British government, the North American colonists, and American Indians, culminating in the creation of a new nation, the United States. The competition among the British, French, and American Indians for economic and political advantage in North America culminated in a series of wars and ultimately to the British defeat of France and indigenous allies."	
	,"One example of causation is that British attempts to assert tighter control over its North American colonies led to a colonial independence movement and the Revolutionary War. The British government’s attempts to tax the colonies without their consent and to enforce laws that restricted colonial trade and other activities led to widespread protests and resistance.

	["During the early 1700s, the Great Awakening was a religious revival that swept through the American colonies and challenged traditional religious authority by emphasizing individual salvation and a personal relationship with God. This movement led to a greater emphasis on individualism and helped lay the groundwork for later democratic movements. Another example is the Enlightenment movement which emphasized reason and individual rights over tradition and authority. This movement helped inspire many of the democratic ideals that were central to the American Revolution."
	, "One comparison is between the Federalist Papers and Anti-Federalist Papers. Both were written during the ratification of the US Constitution and were used to influence public opinion on whether or not to ratify it. The Federalist Papers were written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay and argued for a strong central government with a separation of powers. The Anti-Federalist Papers were written by various authors who opposed the Constitution because they believed it would lead to a tyrannical government.<br /><br />One similarity between these two papers is that they both sought to influence public opinion on whether or not to ratify the US Constitution. However, they differed in their views on what kind of government was best for the United States. The Federalist Papers argued for a strong central government with a separation of powers while the Anti-Federalist Papers argued for a weaker central government with more power given to individual states."
	, "The American Revolution’s democratic and republican ideals inspired new experiments with different forms of government. One example of this was the creation of state constitutions that were written during the Revolutionary War. These constitutions were based on the idea that power should be divided among different branches of government and that citizens should have a say in how they were governed. One specific historical development that was influenced by these ideals was the creation of the United States Constitution. The Constitution was written in 1787 and was based on many of the same principles that were found in the state constitutions. For example, it established a federal system of government that divided power between the national government and state governments. It also created a system of checks and balances that ensured that no one branch of government had too much power."
	, "The American Revolution’s democratic and republican ideals inspired new experiments with different forms of government that changed over time. For example, in 1777 Vermont became the first state to abolish slavery in its constitution. In 1780 Massachusetts became the first state to abolish slavery by judicial decree. In 1787 Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance which prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory."

	["In the early 17th century, the English established colonies in Virginia and Massachusetts Bay. The Virginia Company was chartered in 1606 and Jamestown was founded in 1607. The Massachusetts Bay Company was chartered in 1629 and Boston was founded in 1630. Both colonies were established for economic reasons and were based on agriculture. The Virginia colony was based on tobacco while the Massachusetts Bay colony was based on fishing, shipbuilding, and trade.<br /><br />The establishment of these colonies led to conflicts with Native American tribes who had already been living in the region for centuries. The English colonists often took land from the Native Americans without their consent and this led to violent conflicts between the two groups."
	, "One comparison that can be made between historical developments in this unit is that various American Indian groups repeatedly evaluated and adjusted their alliances with Europeans, other tribes, and the US, seeking to limit migration of white settlers and maintain control of tribal lands and natural resources. British alliances with American Indians contributed to tensions between the US and Britain."
	, "Migration intensified conflicts between European settlers and Native American populations as they competed for resources, boundaries, and trade.<br /><br />One cause of this increased migration was the availability of land in North America. After the Revolutionary War, the newly formed United States government encouraged westward expansion by offering cheap land to settlers. This led to an influx of European migrants who sought economic opportunity and social mobility.<br /><br />One effect of this increased migration was the displacement of Native American populations. As European settlers moved westward, they often encroached on Native American lands, leading to conflicts over resources and boundaries. The United States government often sided with European settlers in these conflicts, leading to the forced removal of Native American populations from their ancestral land."
	, "In the early years of European colonization in North America, there were often attempts to establish trade relationships and alliances with Native American populations. For example, the French and Dutch established trade alliances with Native American populations to acquire furs and other products for export to Europe.<br /><br />However, as European migration to North America increased and competition over resources intensified, conflicts between European settlers and Native American populations became more frequent.

However, this migration also intensified conflicts between European settlers and Native American populations as they competed for resources, boundaries, and trade.<br /><br />These conflicts and the government’s response to them shaped the development of American democracy. The forced removal of Native American populations from their ancestral lands and the government’s siding with European settlers in conflicts over resources and boundaries raised questions about the nation’s democratic ideals and the need to change society and institutions to match them."
	,"One comparison that can be made is the development of democracy and the celebration of a new national culture.<br /><br />On the one hand, the United States began to develop a modern democracy during this time period. This involved expanding the right to vote to more people and increasing representation in government. For example, many states abolished property requirements for voting, allowing more white men to participate in elections. There were also efforts to reform institutions such as prisons and asylums to better align with democratic ideals.<br /><br />On the other hand, Americans also celebrated a new national culture during this time period. This involved the development of a distinct American identity that was separate from European influences. For example, American writers and artists began to produce works that celebrated the nation’s natural beauty and democratic ideals. There were also efforts to create a national system of education that would instill these values in future generations."	
	,"One cause of this expansion was the growth of democracy and the belief that more people should have a say in how they were governed. Many states abolished property requirements for voting, allowing more white men to participate in elections. There were also efforts to extend voting rights to women and African Americans, although these efforts were not successful during this time period.<br /><br />One effect of this expansion was increased participation in elections and greater representation in government. As more people gained the right to vote, voter turnout increased and politicians had to appeal to a broader range of voters. This led to the rise of new political parties and the development of new campaign tactics such as rallies and parades."	
	,"One historical development that changed over time is the definition of American democratic ideals. In the early years of the United States, these ideals were often narrowly defined and only applied to a select group of people. For example, the right to vote was initially limited to white men who owned property.<br /><br />However, over time, these democratic ideals expanded to include more people. Many states abolished property requirements for voting, allowing more white men to participate in elections. There were also efforts to extend voting rights to women and African Americans, although these efforts were not successful during this time period.<br /><br />This expansion of democratic ideals was driven by social and political changes within American society. As more people gained the right to vote and participate in government, there was increased pressure to expand these rights to other groups. This process was not always smooth and there were often conflicts over who should be included in the definition of American democratic ideals."

The debate over slavery became increasingly polarized and eventually led to the outbreak of the Civil War."
	, "One historical development that can be compared within this context is the debate over slavery in the North and South.<br /><br />In the North, there was a growing movement to abolish slavery. This movement was driven by moral, religious, and economic arguments. Abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass argued that slavery was a moral evil that must be abolished. The North also had a growing industrial economy that relied on free labor rather than slave labor.<br /><br />In contrast, the South relied heavily on slave labor to support its agricultural economy. Southern plantation owners argued that slavery was necessary for their economic survival and that it was a positive good for both slaves and slave owners. They also argued that states’ rights should allow them to decide whether or not to allow slavery within their borders.<br /><br />One similarity between these two historical developments is that they were both driven by economic interests. The North sought to abolish slavery in part because it was seen as a threat to their industrial economy while the South sought to preserve slavery because it was seen as essential to their agricultural economy.

	, "One example of how the end of the Cold War prompted a redefinition of foreign policy and role in the world is the shift in U.S.-Soviet relations. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union were engaged in a tense ideological and military standoff. However, with the end of the Cold War, the United States had the opportunity to reassess its relationship with Russia, the successor state to the Soviet Union. This led to diplomatic efforts and arms control negotiations, such as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), aimed at reducing nuclear arsenals. The United States recognized the need to move away from confrontation and embrace a more cooperative approach, reflecting a shift in foreign policy and a redefinition of its role as a global leader.<br /><br />Another example is the response to the challenges posed by terrorism. The end of the Cold War did not signify the end of security threats for the United States but presented new challenges from non-state actors, particularly transnational terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda. In response, the nation had to redefine its foreign policy approach and role in combating terrorism. This included military interventions, such as the U.S. military engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq, aimed at disrupting terrorist networks and ensuring national security. Additionally, the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security and the implementation of enhanced intelligence and counterterrorism operations reflected the nation's determination to address emerging threats.<br /><br />In comparing these examples, we see that the reevaluation of U.S.-Soviet relations emphasized diplomatic efforts and arms control as means of reducing tensions and embracing cooperation. On the other hand, the response to terrorism highlighted the importance of military interventions and domestic security measures, largely increasing tensions."
	, "One specific example is the cause and effect of the Gulf War in 1990-1991. The cause of the Gulf War was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein sought to annex Kuwait, which held significant oil reserves, in an attempt to alleviate Iraq's economic crisis and expand its regional influence. This act of aggression posed a direct threat to regional stability and international security, prompting a response from the United States and its allies.<br /><br />As a result, the United States led a multinational coalition to counter Iraq's aggression in what became known as Operation Desert Storm. The effects of the Gulf War were far-reaching. First, the United States and its coalition partners successfully expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoring its sovereignty. This demonstrated the United States' commitment to protecting its interests and maintaining global order.<br /><br />Second, the Gulf War showcased the United States' military capabilities and its role as a dominant global power. The swift and overwhelming military response by the U.S.-led coalition demonstrated the nation's ability to project force on a large scale and achieved a decisive victory. This bolstered the perception of U.S. military might and solidified its position as a key player in international affairs.<br /><br />Furthermore, the Gulf War also had significant geopolitical implications. The United States, through its leadership in the coalition, was able to rally support from diverse nations and forge stronger alliances in the Middle East and beyond. The war also highlighted the importance of energy security and the need to protect global oil supplies, reinforcing the United States' role as a guardian of international energy resources."

"B. The Columbian Exchange brought new crops to Europe from the Americas, stimulating European population growth, and new sources of mineral wealth, which facilitated the European shift from feudalism to capitalism.<br />Examples:  Introduction of corn, potatoes, and tomatoes to Europe, growth of European nation-states",

   "I. Spanish, French, Dutch, and British colonizers had different economic and imperial goals involving land and labor that shaped the social and political development of their colonies as well as their relationships with native populations."

, "A. Spanish efforts to extract wealth from the land led them to develop institutions based on subjugating native populations, converting them to Christianity, and incorporating them, along with enslaved and free Africans, into the Spanish colonial society.<br />Examples:  Christopher Columbus, Cortez, Pizarro, conquistadores, mission system, encomienda system, New Spain, establishment of Santa Fe (1610)"
           
, "B. French and Dutch colonial efforts involved relatively few Europeans and relied on trade alliances and intermarriage with American Indians to build economic and diplomatic relationships and acquires furs and other products for export to Europe.<br />Examples: Samuel de Champlain, Coureurs de bois, New Netherland, Jesuit missionaries, French alliance with Huron Indians"
           
, "C. English colonization efforts attracted a comparatively large number of male and female British migrants, as well as other European migrants, all of whom sought social mobility, economic prosperity, religious freedom, and improved living conditions. These colonists focused on agriculture and settled on land taken from Native Americans, from whom they lived separately.<br />Examples:  Jamestown (1607), starving time, head-right system, John Rolfe, tobacco as cash crop"
           
, "II. In the 17th century, early British colonies developed along the Atlantic coast, with regional differences that reflected various environmental, economic, cultural, and demographic factors.",

"A. The Chesapeake and North Carolina colonies grew prosperous exporting tobacco — a labor-intensive product initially cultivated by white, mostly male indentured servants and later by enslaved Africans.<br />Examples:  Middle Passage, indentured servants, Bacon’s Rebellion (1676), Chesapeake colonies, racial hierarchy",
 
"B. The New England colonies, initially settled by Puritans, developed around small towns with family farms and achieved a thriving mixed economy of agriculture and commerce.<br />Examples:  Puritan work ethic, town meetings, expanded life expectancy in New England, social hierarchy, blue laws, subsistence farming, John Winthrop’s “city upon a hill”, Salem witch trials, trial of Anne Hutchinson, banishment of Roger Williams, establishment of Harvard College (1636)",
                                   
"C. The middle colonies supported a flourishing export economy based on cereal crops and attracted a broad range of European migrants, leading to societies with greater cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity and tolerance.<br />Examples:  William Penn, Quakers, religious toleration, “middle way”, ethnic diversity, “bread-basket colonies”",
           
"D. The colonies of the southernmost Atlantic coast and the British West Indies used long growing seasons to develop plantation economies based on exporting staple crops. They depended on the labor of enslaved Africans, who often constituted the majority of the population in these areas and developed their own forms of cultural and religious autonomy.<br />Examples: rice as cash crop in Georgia and the Carolinas, sugar as cash crop in Barbados, slave codes, Gullah, ring-shout, spirituals",
 
"E. Distance and Britain’s initially lax attention led to the colonies creating self-governing institutions that were unusually democratic for the era. The New England colonies based power in participatory town meetings, which in turn elected members to their colonial legislatures; in the Southern colonies, elite planters exercised local authority and also dominated the elected assemblies.<br />Examples:  Mayflower Compact (1620), Maryland Toleration Act (1649), House of Burgesses, Massachusetts General Court",
           
"III. Competition over resources between European rivals and American Indians encouraged industry and trade and led to conflict in the Americas.",

"A. An Atlantic economy developed in which goods, as well as enslaved Africans and American Indians, were exchanged between Europe, Africa, and theAmericas through extensive trade networks. European colonial economies focused on acquiring, producing, and exporting commodities that were valued in Europe and gaining new sources of labor.<br />Examples:  Triangular trade routes, direct trade routes, Middle Passage",
           
"B. Continuing trade with Europeans increased the flow of goods in and out of American Indian communities, stimulating cultural and economic changes and spreading epidemic diseases that caused radical demographic shifts.<br />Examples:  Praying towns, fur trade",
           
"C. Interactions between European rivals and American Indian populations fostered both accommodation and conflict. French, Dutch, British, and Spanish colonies allied with and armed American Indian groups, who frequently sought alliances with Europeans against other Indian groups.<br />Examples:  Beaver Wars of the mid-1600s, Chickasaw Wars of the mid-1700s, King William’s War (1688-1697), Queen Anne’s War (1702-1713), King George’s War (1744-1748)",
           
"D. The goals and interests of European leaders and colonists at times diverged, leading to a growing mistrust on both sides of the Atlantic. Colonists, especially in British North America, expressed dissatisfaction over issues including territorial settlements, frontier defense, self-rule, and trade.<br />Examples: Bacon’s Rebellion (1676), revocation of Massachusetts’ charter, Navigation Acts/smuggling, protests against the Dominion of New England",    

"E. British conflicts with American Indians over land, resources, and political boundaries led to military confrontations, such as Metacom’s War (King Philip’s War) in New England.<br />Examples: Anglo-Powhatan Wars (1610-1640s), Pequot War (1636-1637), King Philip’s War (1675-1676)",

 ,"B. The British colonies experienced a gradual Anglicization over time, developing autonomous political communities based on English models with influence from inter-colonial commercial ties, the emergence of a trans-Atlantic print culture, and the spread of Protestant evangelicalism.<br />Examples:  Anglicization, republicanism, salutary neglect, trial of John Peter Zenger"
  
 ,"C. The British government increasingly attempted to incorporate its North American colonies into a coherent, hierarchical, and imperial structure in order to pursue mercantilist economic aims, but conflicts with colonists and American Indians led to erratic enforcement of imperial policies.<br />Examples:  Mercantilism, Board of Trade, Navigation Act of the 1660s, Dominion of New England, Wool Act of 1699, Molasses Act of 1733"
  
 ,"D. Colonists’ resistance to imperial control drew on local experiences of self- government, evolving ideas of liberty, the political thought of the Enlightenment, greater religious independence and diversity, and an ideology critical of perceived corruption in the imperial system. <br />Examples:  Widespread smuggling, Dominion of New England/Edmond Andros, First Great Awakening (J. Edwards & G. Whitefield), John Locke"
			
 ,"II. Like other European empires in the Americas that participated in the Atlantic slave trade, the English colonies developed a system of slavery that reflected the specific economic, demographic, and geographic characteristics of those colonies."
 
 ,"​A. All the British colonies participated to varying degrees in the Atlantic slave trade due to the abundance of land and a growing European demand forcolonial goods, as well as a shortage of indentured servants.  Small New England farms used relatively few enslaved laborers, all port cities held significant minorities of enslaved people, and the emerging plantation systems of the Chesapeake and the southernmost Atlantic coast had large numbers of enslaved workers, while the great majority of enslaved Africans were sent to the West Indies.<br />Examples:  Triangular trade, Middle Passage, plantation agriculture"
			
 ,"B. As chattel slavery became the dominant labor system in many southern colonies, new laws created a strict racial system that prohibited interracial relationships and defined the descendants of African American mothers as black and enslaved in perpetuity.<br />Examples:  Barbados slave code, Stone Rebellion of 1739, NYC slave revolt of 1741"
			
 ,"C. Africans developed both overt and covert means to resist the dehumanizing aspects of slavery and maintain their family and gender systems, culture, and religion.<br />Examples:  Work slowdowns, runaway slaves, NYC slave revolt (1711), Stono Rebellion (1739)"

   "A. Colonial rivalry intensified between Britain and France in the mid-18th century, as the growing population of the British colonies expanded into the interior of North America, threatening French–Indian trade networks and American Indian autonomy.<br />Examples:  French-Huron alliance, British-Iroquois alliance, French and Indian War, Albany Plan of Union, Treaty of Paris",
           
"B. Britain achieved a major expansion of its territorial holdings by defeating the French, but at tremendous expense, setting the stage for imperial efforts to raise revenue and consolidate control over the colonies.<br />Examples:  End of salutary neglect, writs of assistance, use of admiralty courts to try smugglers, virtual representation of Parliament",
           
"C. After the British victory, imperial officials’ attempts to prevent colonists from moving westward generated colonial opposition, while native groups sought to both continue trading with Europeans and resist the encroachments of colonists on tribal lands.<br />Examples:  Pontiac’s War, Proclamation of 1763, Iroquois Confederacy, Chief Little Turtle and the Western Confederacy (1793-1795)",
           
"II. The desire of many colonists to assert ideals of self-government in the face of renewed British imperial efforts led to a colonial independence movement and war with Britain",

"A. The imperial struggles of the mid-18th century, as well as new British efforts to collect taxes without direct colonial representation or consent and to assert imperial authority in the colonies, began to unite the colonists against perceived and real constraints on their economic activities and political rights.<br />Examples:  Sugar Act (1764), Stamp Act (1765), Quartering Act (1765), Declaratory Act (1766), Townshend Acts (1767), Tea Act (1773), Intolerable Acts (1774), Quebec Act (1774)",

Colonial leaders based their calls for resistance to Britain on arguments about the rights of British subjects, the rights of the individual, local traditions of self-rule, and the ideas of the Enlightenment.<br />Examples:  Taxation without representation, consent of the governed, republicanism, bicameral colonial legislatures, natural rights",
           
"C. The effort for American independence was energized by colonial leaders such as Benjamin Franklin, as well as by popular movements that included the political activism of laborers, artisans, and women.<br />Examples:  Otis Warren, Paul Revere, Mercy Otis Warren, John Hancock, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Sons of Liberty, Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania (John Dickinson), Stamp Act Congress (1765), Boston Tea Party, committees of correspondence, First and Second Continental Congress",

"E. Despite considerable loyalist opposition, as well as Great Britain’s apparently overwhelming military and financial advantages, the Patriot cause succeeded because of the actions of colonial militias and the Continental Army, George Washington’s military leadership, the colonists’ ideological commitment and resilience, and assistance sent by European allies.<br />Examples:  Battle of Trenton, Battle of Saratoga, French Alliance, Battle of Yorktown"

"B. The colonists’ belief in the superiority of republican forms of government based on the natural rights of the people found expression in Thomas Paine’s Common Sense and the Declaration of Independence. The ideas in these documents resonated throughout American history, shaping Americans’ understanding of the ideals on which the nation was based.<br />Examples:  Common Sense, Declaration of Independence, republicanism, natural rights",

"C. During and after the American Revolution, an increased awareness of inequalities in society motivated some individuals and groups to call for the abolition of slavery and greater political democracy in the new state and national governments.<br />Examples:  Quakers, Abigail Adams’ “remember the ladies”, Pennsylvania gradual emancipation law (1780), Vermont constitution abolished slavery, reduction of state property requirements to vote, abolition societies, separation of church and state, Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom (1786)",

"D. In response to women’s participation in the American Revolution, Enlightenment ideas, and women’s appeals for expanded roles, an ideal of “republican motherhood” gained popularity.

"II. After declaring independence, American political leaders created new constitutions and declarations of rights that articulated the role of the state and federal governments while protecting individual liberties and limiting both centralized power and excessive popular influence.",
 
"A. Many new state constitutions placed power in the hands of the legislative branch and maintained property qualifications for voting and citizenship.<br />Examples:  Conventions to ratify constitutions, fundamental laws, strong state legislatures combined with weak governors and courts",
           
"B. The Articles of Confederation unified the newly independent states, creating a central government with limited power. After the Revolution, difficulties over international trade, finances, interstate commerce, foreign relations, and internal unrest led to calls for a stronger central government.<br />Examples:  Unicameral legislature with no power to tax, draft soldiers, or regulate trade; lack of judicial or executive branch; tariff and currency disputes; Spanish restrictions on Mississippi River; British occupation of forts on US land; Shay’s Rebellion; Newburgh Conspiracy; Annapolis Convention",
           
"C.  Delegates from the states participated in a Constitutional Convention and through negotiation, collaboration, and compromise proposed a constitution that created a limited but dynamic central government embodying federalism and providing for a separation of powers between its three branches.<br />Examples:  Great (Connecticut) Compromise, checks and balances, separation of powers, Electoral College, Supreme Court, republicanism, federalism",
           
"D. The Constitutional Convention compromised over the representation of slave states in Congress and the role of the federal government in regulating both slavery and the slave trade, allowing the prohibition of the international slave trade after 1808.<br />Examples:  Three-fifths compromise, slave trade compromise, fugitive slave clause",

"E. In the debate over ratifying the Constitution, Anti-Federalists opposing ratification battled with Federalists, whose principals were articulated in the Federalist Papers (primarily written by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison). Federalists ensured the ratification of the Constitution by promising the addition of a Bill of Rights that enumerated individual rights and explicitly restricted the powers of the federal government.<br />Examples:  Federalist Papers, Bill of Rights, Federalists vs. Anti-Federalists",

"III. New forms of national culture and political institutions developed in the United States alongside continued regional variations and differences over economic, political, social, and foreign policy issues.",

"A. During the presidential administrations of George Washington and John Adams, political leaders created institutions and precedents that put the principles of the Constitution into practice.<br />Examples:  Executive branch departments, Cabinet, Judiciary Act of 1789",
                                   
"B. Political leaders in the 1790s took a variety of positions on issues such as the relationship between the national government and the states, economic policy, foreign policy, and the balance between liberty and order. This led to the formation of political parties — most significantly the Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, and the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.<br />Examples:  Hamilton’s financial plan, creation of the Bank of the US, elastic clause, strict vs. loose interpretation of the Constitution, formation of the Federalist Party, formation of the Democratic-Republican Party, Alien and Sedition Acts, Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions by Jefferson and Madison",

Various American Indian groups repeatedly evaluated and adjusted their alliances with Europeans, other tribes, and the U.S., seeking to limit migration of white settlers and maintain control of tribal lands and natural resources. British alliances with American Indians contributed to tensions between the U.S. and Britain.<br />Examples:  March of the Paxton Boys, Battle of Fallen Timbers (1794), Treaty of Greenville (1795)",
           
"B. As increasing numbers of migrants from North America and other parts of the world continued to move westward, frontier cultures that had emerged in the colonial period continued to grow, fueling social, political, and ethnic tensions.<br />Examples:  Scots-Irish migration to the frontier, frontier vs. tidewater Virginia, Whiskey Rebellion, Regulator Movement",
           
"C.

	"I. Ideological and economic differences over slavery produced an array of diverging responses from Americans in the North and the South.",

	"A. The North’s expanding manufacturing economy relied on free labor in contrast to the Southern economy’s dependence on slave labor. Some Northerners did not object to slavery on principle but claimed that slavery would undermine the free labor market. As a result, a free-soil movement arose that portrayed the expansion of slavery as incompatible with free labor.<br />Examples:  Bessemer process (1855), Oil drilling in Titusville, Pennsylvania (1859), Free Soil Party (1848-1852), Hinton Helper’s Impending Crisis of the South (1857)",
           
"B. African American and white abolitionists, although a minority in the North, mounted a highly visible campaign against slavery, presenting moral arguments against the institution, assisting slaves’ escapes, and sometimes expressing a willingness to use violence to achieve their goals.<br />Examples:  William Lloyd Garrison’s Liberator and the American Antislavery Society, Liberty Party (1840-1844), Underground Railroad, Harriet Tubman (1849), Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1852), John Brown’s Raid on Harper’s Ferry (1859)",

Calhoun, states’ rights, nullification, George Fitzhugh’s Cannibals All! (1857), minstrel shows",
 
"II. Debates over slavery came to dominate political discussion in the 1850s, culminating in the bitter election of 1860 and the secession of Southern states.",

"A. The Mexican Cession led to heated controversies over whether to allow slavery in the newly acquired territories.<br />Examples:  end of gag rule (1844), Wilmot Proviso (1846), Mexican Cession (1848), popular sovereignty",
 
"B. The courts and national leaders made a variety of attempts to resolve the issue of slavery in the territories, including the Compromise of 1850, the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and the Dred Scott decision, but these ultimately failed to reduce conflict.   <br />Examples:  Compromise of 1850, Fugitive Slave Act (1850), personal liberty laws, Kansas Nebraska Act (1854), “Crime against Kansas Speech” by Charles Sumner and attack by Preston Brooks (1856), Pottawatomie Creek, Dispute over Lecompton Constitution (1857), Bleeding Kansas (1856-1861), Dred Scott Supreme Court decision (1857)",

[
	"I. The North’s greater manpower and industrial resources, the leadership of Abraham Lincoln and others, and the decision to emancipate slaves eventually led to the Union military victory over the Confederacy in the devastating Civil War.",

	"A. Both the Union and the Confederacy mobilized their economies and societies to wage the war even while facing considerable home front opposition.<br />Examples:  Lincoln’s suspension of habeas corpus (1861), Morrill Tariff (1861), Southern Conscription Act (1862), National Bank Act (1863), Northern Conscription Act of 1863, “rich man’s war but a poor man’s fight”, NYC draft riots (1863), Radical Republicans, War Democrats, Peace Democrats, Copperheads, Order of the Sons of Liberty (1864)", 
 
"B. Lincoln and most Union supporters began the Civil War to preserve the Union, but Lincoln’s decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation reframed the purpose of the war and helped prevent the Confederacy from gaining full diplomatic support from European powers. Many African Americans fled southern plantations and enlisted in the Union Army, helping to undermine the Confederacy.<br />Examples:  Trent Affair (1861), Alabama commerce raider (1862), Emancipation Proclamation (1863), enlistment of African Americans, Massachusetts 54th Regiment (1863)",

"D. Although the Confederacy showed military initiative and daring early in the war, the Union ultimately succeeded due to improvements in leadership and strategy, key victories, greater resources, and the wartime destruction of the South’s infrastructure..<br />Examples:  Anaconda Plan (1861), Antietam (1862), Gettysburg (1863), Vicksburg (1863), Union’s “total war” strategy, Sherman’s March to the Sea (1864), Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Courthouse (1865)",

"C. Efforts by radical and moderate Republicans to change the balance of power between Congress and the presidency and to reorder race relations in the defeated South yielded some short-term successes. Reconstruction opened up political opportunities and other leadership roles to former slaves, but it ultimately failed, due both to determined Southern resistance and the North’s waning resolve.<br />Examples:  Black codes, Ku Klux Klan (1866), Presidential vs. Radical Reconstruction (1865-1867), Military Reconstruction (1867-1877), carpetbaggers, scalawags, Senator Hiram Revels, Senator Blache K Bruce, Representative Robert Smalls, Johnson’s veto of Freedman’s Bureau and Civil Rights Act of 1866, Tenure of Office Act (1867), impeachment of President Johnson (1868), Redeemer governments (Solid South), Enforcement Acts (1870-1871)",
 
"D. Southern plantation owners continued to own the majority of the region’s land even after Reconstruction. Former slaves sought land ownership but generally fell short of self-sufficiency, as an exploitative and soil-intensive sharecropping system limited blacks’ and poor whites’ access to land in the South.<br />Examples:  black codes, sharecropping, tenant farming, crop-lien system, peonage system, Freedmen’s Bureau (1865)",

"E. Segregation, violence, Supreme Court decisions, and local political tactics progressively stripped away African American rights, but the 14th and 15th Amendments eventually became the basis for court decisions upholding civil rights in the 20th century.<br />Examples:  Compromise of 1877, poll taxes, literacy tests to vote, Jim Crow laws, grandfather clauses.

Many farmers responded to the increasing consolidation in agricultural markets and their dependence on the evolving railroad system by creating local and regional cooperative organizations.<br />Examples: Grange (1867), Granger laws, Wabash v. Illinois (1886), Southern Farmers’ Alliance (1875), National Farmers’ Alliance (1877), Colored Farmers’ Alliance (1886)",

"II. Dramatic social changes in the period inspired political debates over citizenship, corruption, and the proper relationship between business and government.",

Facing increased violence, discrimination, and scientific theories of race, African American reformers continued to fight for political and social equality.<br />Examples:  Jim Crow laws, poll taxes, grandfather clauses, literacy tests to vote, Impact of Plessy v. Ferguson, Booker T. Washington’s Atlanta Compromise (1895), Ida Wells-Barnett’s anti-lynching crusade, National Association of Colored Women (1896), Paul Lawrence Dunbar’s Lyrics of Lowly Life (1896), George Washington Carver"
